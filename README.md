## General info  
Pet project where I use Go, Kubernetes, Redis. Three microservices combined into one mechanism. My main inspirations are:  
1) recruitment process in one of the companies in Warsaw (Poland) that uses a similar tech stack,  
2) conversation with a friend, senior developer,  
3) [**this**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uS1KcjkWdoU) scene!
